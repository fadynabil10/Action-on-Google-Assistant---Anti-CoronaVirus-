Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.\nPull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.\nAfter use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.\nDiscard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.\nPerform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
