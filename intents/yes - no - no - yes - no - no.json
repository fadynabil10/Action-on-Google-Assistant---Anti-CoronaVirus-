Based on your answers, you do not need to check the virus at this time.\nWe hope that anyone who develops symptoms that include coughing, runny nose, fever and sore throat will self-quit for 14 days.\nTo protect yourself in public places, please wash your hands frequently and intensively, and keep at least 2 meters from the surroundings\nIf symptoms worsen or if you are interested in learning more, call 105 to speak with the nursing staff if you are in Egypt or if you are in another country speak to the nursing staff for this country.\nHow else may I help?"
